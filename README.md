Yes, absolutely. While most people think fertility centres only focus on women, the truth is male infertility is just as common. In fact, in around 40% of infertility cases, the issue is either fully or partly due to male factors. At Ayuh Fertility Centre in Ahmedabad, they provide proper care and treatment for men too â€” not just women.

Dr. Krupa Shah and her team understand that men may feel awkward or shy to talk about these problems. Thatâ€™s why the clinic has created a respectful, private, and supportive environment where men can also get the help they need without feeling judged or uncomfortable.

The first step is usually a semen analysis, which checks the count, shape, and motility (movement) of the sperm. Itâ€™s a simple and painless test. Based on the results, the team at Ayuh can tell whether the sperm is healthy enough for natural conception or if assistance is needed.

For mild problems like slightly low sperm count or weak motility, the clinic may recommend lifestyle changes, supplements, or IUI (Intrauterine Insemination) â€” where the sperm is washed and placed directly into the uterus at the right time of ovulation.

For more severe cases like very low count, zero sperm (azoospermia), or sperm that canâ€™t fertilize an egg properly, Ayuh uses ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection). Itâ€™s an advanced technique where a single healthy sperm is injected directly into the egg during an IVF cycle. This method has helped many couples conceive even when the sperm quality was very poor.

They also do tests like DNA fragmentation index (DFI) if needed, which checks the genetic quality of the sperm. If the sperm DNA is damaged, it can cause repeated IVF failures or miscarriages. Ayuh treats such issues with medicines, antioxidants, and sometimes recommends surgical sperm retrieval.

And itâ€™s not just about treatment â€” they also help men understand what affects their fertility. Things like smoking, alcohol, stress, poor sleep, being overweight, and tight clothing can impact sperm health. The team at Ayuh gives full guidance on how to improve these factors naturally.

So yes, Ayuh Fertility Centre is fully equipped and experienced in dealing with male infertility too. They treat both partners with equal care and importance â€” because after all, it takes two to make a baby.
